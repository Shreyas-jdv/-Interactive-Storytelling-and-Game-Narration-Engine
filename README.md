# Interactive Storytelling and Game Narration Engine

## Overview

The Interactive Storytelling and Game Narration Engine is a project designed to create a dynamic storytelling engine using a Large Language Model (LLM). This engine can generate engaging narratives and dialogue for games or interactive fiction based on user inputs and choices, enhancing the interactivity and personalization of the gaming experience.

## Key Requirements

- **Train an LLM**: Utilize a diverse corpus of stories, scripts, and game dialogues to train the LLM for effective narrative generation.
- **Real-time Narrative Generation**: Implement a system that adapts to user choices and generates narratives in real-time.
- **Integration with Game Engines**: Ensure compatibility with game development engines (e.g., Unity) for seamless content creation and integration.
- **Features**: Include capabilities for character development, plot progression, and branching storylines to enrich the narrative experience.

## Research Focus

- **Procedural Content Generation**: Explore how LLMs can be utilized to generate unique and engaging narratives in real-time, responding dynamically to user interactions.
- **Emotion and Character Development**: Investigate how LLMs can create emotionally resonant characters and evolving story arcs based on user choices.
- **Interactive Fiction and Gaming**: Examine the integration of LLMs into gaming environments to deliver immersive and personalized experiences for players.
